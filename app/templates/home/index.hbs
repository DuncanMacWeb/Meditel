									<p>Meditel is way of providing information to Community Health
										Workers in Rural Africa providing them with more tools in order
										to:</p>

									<ul>
										<li>Enable fast and appropriate decisions to be made
											regarding an individualâ€™s care</li>

										<li>Share knowledge to empower community health
											workers</li>

										<li>Reduce the burden on overstretched health facilities by
											only referring serious cases forward</li>
									</ul>
					
									<p>Meditel does this by accessing a decision tree through an SMS like function called USSD. USSD enables community health worker through a series of questions to determine an answer.</p>
